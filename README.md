<h1>Blessure au sport <h1>
When i was younger, i try all sport but my favorites sport is Basket ball.
After 3 years of this sport i was obligatory to stop it because my legs is broken because i try to dunk 
The doctors forced me to do it to avoid any complications that could have led to amputation.
The hesitation was still there, because I really love this sport and I had no desire to stop.
